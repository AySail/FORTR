  <h2>Fun Facts About Mars</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Mars has the tallest volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons.</li>
    <li>One day on Mars is about 24.6 hours.</li>
    <li>Scientists believe there was once water on Mars.</li>
    <li>The red color comes from iron oxide (rust) on its surface.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Upcoming Mars Missions</h2>
  <p>NASA and other space agencies are planning exciting new missions to explore Mars, including rovers, landers, and even potential human landings in the future.</p>

  <h2>Why Explore Mars?</h2>
  <p>Studying Mars helps us understand the possibility of life on other planets, the history of our solar system, and how humans might live beyond Earth one day.</p>

  <h2>Humans on mars?</h2>
  <p>Scientists and engineers are actively working on plans to send humans to Mars within the next few decades. Challenges like long space travel, life support, and safe landing are being tackled to make Mars colonization a reality. Living on Mars would open new frontiers for exploration and possibly even new homes for humanity.</p>
 <h2>Water on mars?</h2>
  <p>Evidence from satellites and rovers shows that water once flowed on Mars, carving valleys and shaping its landscape. Today, water mostly exists as ice beneath the surface and at the poles. Finding and using this water is key to supporting future missions and possibly sustaining human life on the Red Planet.</p>
<h2>News?</h2>
  <p>Recent developments in Mars exploration have brought exciting insights. NASA's Curiosity rover has discovered long-chain organic molecules on Mars, suggesting the planet may have once had conditions suitable for life . Additionally, SpaceX plans to launch its Starship spacecraft to Mars by the end of 2026, with potential human landings as early as 2029 . These advancements highlight the ongoing efforts to understand and explore the Red Planet</p>
